2. Enter your bot's token and name into TelegramBot.java (18 and 23 line)
3. Get your Spotify token on https://developer.spotify.com/console/get-playlists/ and than enter it into Start.java (15 line)
4. Start Main.java

For local file
1. Get your Spotify token on https://developer.spotify.com/console/get-playlists/ and than enter it into Start.java (15 line)
